# Class 3 reading notes

## Chapter 3 (Html)
+ This chapter is concerned with how you organize information into various types of lists 
+ List types include : unorder list, ordered list, nested lists and definition list.
+ It is worth mentioning that definition lists include definition term and its definition 

##  Chapter 13 (Html)
+ All elemnts are initiated inside of a box in html, therefore it is important to know how to control the size and appearance of these boxes
+ The most apart variables are the width and height elements, it is also worth mentioning that incase the content of the box doesnt fit, you could use the overflow property to decide on what to do with the excess information (such as hidden or scroll)
+ The box model includes values such as padding, boarders and margin. The developer can then alter the style, size and positioning of text inside these boxes using different properties 

## Chapter 2(Javascript)
+ This part of the chapter includes how variable definition is bieng carried out, how to declare it and even the assignment of values to it later on

## Chapter 4(Javascript)
+ In this part of the chapter a new conditional statement was introduced called the switch case, this has a similar function to the IF statement except it requires less effort to develop and its recommended over nested if statements where the statement is provided with a key that it compares to different cases and carries out the cases in which the key matches the condition of the case
+ The later part of the chapter talks about loops, including the *for*, *while* and *do while* loops. These are used when a specific line of code is to be repeated a number of times (for loop), or to be repeated as long as a certain condition is true (While loop/ do while)
+ The difference between the *while* and *do while*, is the fact that in the later the code will run atleast one time before the while condition is checked.
