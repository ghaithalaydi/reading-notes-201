+ Objects are a combination of functions and variables, and an object a variable becomes a property and a function becomes a method, coming together to create what we call an object.
+ Objects are considered a type of variable, and thus declares with a var notation and inside the curly braces keys are declared for both varialbes and functions followed by a double colon 
+ To call a property from a function either use the dot or square bracket notations after the object name *object.property name*

## Chapter 5 (Java Script)
+ DOM or document object model is a tree representation of how the page content are linked between attributes, main , element and text nodes
+ Methods to find DOM elements are called queries, an example of such would be getElementById(); a query by which an element with a specific ID is fetched to start working with it 
+ when you store an element in a variable, you are really only storing the node of that element 
+ When you call multiple elements at once the returned values are bundled into a nodelist, where you can use the item() query to pick and choose the element of interest 
+ To select and apply changes to items of a nodelist, you can loop through the list to apply it on all of those elements
+ You can add/remove HTMl elements from the DOM by either following the innerHTML property or the DOM manipulation 
+ You can use multiple toold to access your DOM from your browser
