# Class 2 Reading notes

## Chapter 2 (HTML BOOK)
+ In this chapter the concept of editing the visual content (specifically text) is further explained
+ H 1-6 tags are used to highlight important headers on the rendered page
+ if you want to directly mark something as bold or italic you can use the b and i tags respectively 
+ There are tags that provide the superscript <sup> and the subscript <sub> syntax
+ Spaces and even breaks are always recognized for a single space by the browsers, so in order to over come that if required a br/ tag or a hr/ tag is used at the point a new line is required
+ the stong tag does the same editing funtions as the bold

## Chapter 10 (HTML BOOK)
+ Introducing Css onto your webpage, allows the developer to style specific blocks of elements defined on the html page
+ This is used by choosing your selector then assigning values to the intended properties 
+ Naturally when using external css files to style your page, a link tag should be used with reference to the sheet path and by sitting the relationaship attribute to stylesheet
+ Another  way of styling is by internal means, i.e direct styling on the html file by using the style tags
+ Cascading in Css is top to bottom with the later having the higher priority 

## Chapter 2(Java Script)
+ A script by definition is a series of functions carried out by a browser in a line by line matter
+ The basic building block of a script is a statement, where it usually ends with a semicolon
+ To add comments to your JS file simple use the double forward slash signs
+ Variables are simple containers for temporary hold of information bits
+ Variables for now are made up for 3 main types number, string and boolean
+ Basic rules for variable naming include: it must not start with a number, taking note of case sensetivity, must not include dashes or dots, cannot use keywords or reserved words, try to use clear and rational naming and finally if the name is made up of two words make sure that the first starts with lowercase and the second with upper
+ Expressions are used to evalutes values, either by assigning the values (=) or by using to values to assign a final single value (3*2)
+ Operators are used in expressions to determine the final resulting value, by either carrying out an arithmetic function or a string operator such as (+) for concatanation purposes

## Chapter 4 (Java Script)
+ In most scripts, the code can take more than one path depending on the scenario if the current run which is relating to the logical flow of data
+ Now to define these paths, conditions must be applied, these consist of an expression evalutation and a condition 
+ Usually in conditions operators are used, example of such are the following == or !== or === or != or < or >
+ Example of the syntax would be if (Condition) {
    Carry the following if true
}
+ You can also have multiple conditions by using the operator and / or  which equate to &&/ ||
