# Class 10 Reading notes

## Chapter 10(JavaScript)
+ To properly debug codes in Java we need to know how the code is run through it, this is done by means of stacking where java runs on piece of code at a time, and if anything is required from elsewhere while this function is running it stacks it and moves to the location where it retrieves it from.
+ There are various error syntax in java, but it mainly describes the error type and details about that error, in order to properly debug an error you need to start tracing the code for it fixing one step at at time
+ The use of the console element in the inspection tab is prominent to the debugging process 
+ One of the very useful tools in the inspect element is the breakpoint, under the source tab in which if you click on a specific line you can break the code there and it will stop executing once reached 
+ You can even define conditions for your breakpoint, for example providing a variable and a restricting value
